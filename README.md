**Test your iOS and Android app logic without a screen.**

Reflex lets a test or an AI agent talk to your app in plain text. `ls` asks what’s on screen and `do` presses a button. Your iOS and Android apps must give the same answer. Based on Shopify Engineering’s [Reflex](https://shopify.engineering/reflex) article. Not affiliated with Shopify.

## Try it

You need macOS, Xcode, JDK 17 and Python 3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashishkharche/reflex.git
cd reflex
bash scripts/build.sh
python3 scripts/console.py swift
```

Then type:

```text
> ls
{"ok":true,"node":{"name":"InventoryList","state":{"products":[…]},"actions":["OpenProduct","Refresh","goBack"]}}
> do OpenProduct {"id":"shirt"}
{"ok":true,"node":{"name":"InventoryDetail","state":{"product":{"id":"shirt","quantity":3,…},"saved":false},…}}
```

Now check that both apps agree:

```bash
python3 runner/reflex_runner.py tests/inventory/reflex.json --platform both
```

You should see `RESULT PASS`.

## Use it in your app

1. Keep your ViewModel as it is.
2. Add a small adapter that lists its state and actions. See the [Swift and Kotlin example](kit/README.md).
3. Write the steps you want checked in a JSON file and run them on both apps.
